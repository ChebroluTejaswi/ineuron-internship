Benign URLs: Over 35,300 benign URLs were collected from Alexa top websites. 
The domains have been passed through a Heritrix web crawler to extract the URLs. 
Around half a million unique URLs are crawled initially and then passed to remove 
duplicate and domain only URLs. Later the extracted URLs have been checked through 
Virustotal to filter the benign URLs.
